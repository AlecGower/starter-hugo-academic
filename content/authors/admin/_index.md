I’m a PhD student at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg. I am developing machine intelligence for a robot scientist, Genesis.

Under the leadership of Professor Ross King, our lab’s goal is to automate scientific discovery. Our research concerns improved understanding of eukaryotic cell function using the model organism *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*.

The King Lab is part of the Systems and Synthetic Biology division of the Biology and Biological Engineering Department.
